# GoodLuck Trucking
## Description
Very interactive restaurant script where you either get a semi truck or bring your own, pickup a random trailer type (plan on implementing job rep to unlock different trailers), and then drive to various locations and line the trailer up and make a delivery.
## How it Works
1. Picking up a trialer
    - You get a random type of trailer (gas, misc, beer, chicken)
    - Backup to the marked trailer and grab it

2. Drive to the delivery location and line the trailer up in the appropriate direction
    - At this step you have to actually line the trailer up in a correct manner which sometimes takes quite a bit of backing up skill

3. Unloading the trailer
    - Here you get out and go to the rear of the trailer and step into the red circle to do an animation to help unload the contents

4. Continue delivering to various different locations around the map until you complete X amount of drop offs

5. Return the trailer
    - Return the trailer from where you picked it up. This gives you a bit of a reward (to prevent them from being left out)
